# Image

Element displaying a surface. Not interactive by default, changing those settings will convert it to a button. The background and the outline are removed by default.

Change the `inner_anchor` setting to decide where the surface will be anchored to.

You can change or get the surface with the `surface` setting or `surface` property.
